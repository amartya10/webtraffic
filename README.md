## Problem Statement
Given a file of web traffic data, write a solution to find the top N 3-step sequences that users follow.
Unique users are identified by a session id, and actions are identified by a page id.
The file is in CSV format with 3 values on each line. It will include a header row. The file is sorted by
timestamp.
Output should be formatted with each line being a unique 3-step sequence followed by the number of
occurrences of that sequence,formatted as “<step1>,<step2>,<step3>:<count>” and ordered by count.
Records for users that did not visit at least 3 pages should be ignored.
The solution can be submitted in the language of your choice. Code should include comments
describing your algorithm.


## Example

```timestamp,session_id,page_id
2023-01-01T00:00:01Z,abc-123,search
2023-01-01T00:00:39Z,abc-456,detail-2
2023-01-01T00:02:03Z,abc-123,detail-2
2023-01-01T00:10:14Z,abc-123,detail-1
2023-01-01T00:11:14Z,abc-789,search
2023-01-01T00:14:01Z,abc-456,detail-1
2023-01-01T00:14:15Z,abc-456,cart
2023-01-01T00:21:01Z,abc-123,cart
```

Your code should produce:
detail-2,detail-1,cart:2
search,detail-2,detail-1:1

## Bonus

Add support for supplying a sequence length, rather than specifically looking for 3 step sequences.


## Solution
1. web traffic is already sorted by time-stamp 
2. get user-visited pages 
   ```abc-123: search -> detail-2 -> detail-1 -> cart
   abc-456: detail-2 -> detail-1 -> cart
   abc-789: search
   ```

3. 
    1. for each user visited page will generate a sequnce for the required length default length is 3
    ```abc-123 user sequence is 
         search,detail-2,detail-1
         detail-2,detail-1,cart
       abc-456 user sequence is
         detail-2,detail-1,cart
       and user abc-789 will be skipped
     ```

    2. count how many times same sequnce is generated by different users
         ```
         search,detail-2,detail-1 : 1
         detail-2,detail-1,cart : 2
          ```

    3. sort sequences by count in descending order
        ```
        detail-2 -> detail-1 -> cart: 2
        search -> detail-2 -> detail-1 : 1
        ```

5. print results
     

## How to run 

change directory 

```
cd webtraffic
```

usage default csv from path ./resource/default.csv and sequence count value 3
```
python src/main.py 
```

for custom input  
```
python src/main.py file_path sequence_count
```

## Result 

```
INFO:root:Using Default CSV file and Sequence Count value 3
INFO:root:CSV file read path ./resource/default.csv
INFO:root:User count: 3
INFO:root:--result--
detail-2,detail-1,cart:2
search,detail-2,detail-1:1
INFO:root:!--result--
```


## Test-Case 

1. User input file and custom sequence count value pass
    input :  resource/default.csv, sequence count 2       
    status : passed
2. Same user session create a repeated sequence that should be ignore
   abc-123 user session repeating sequence "search,detail-2,detail-1"
   input : resource/test_case_1.csv
   status : passed
